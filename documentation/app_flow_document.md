# everything-app App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first visits the everything-app, they land on a clean welcome page that briefly explains the app’s AI-powered tools. From here, the user can click a prominent button labeled “Sign Up” to begin creating an account. On the sign-up page, the user enters their email address and a secure password, confirms the password, and submits the form. If any field is missing or the email is in the wrong format, an inline message appears under the field explaining what needs correction. After successful submission, the user is automatically signed in and taken to the main dashboard.

For returning users, there is a “Sign In” link on the welcome page. The sign-in page asks for the same email and password combination. If the credentials are invalid, an error message appears above the form stating that the email or password is incorrect. Below the sign-in fields, there is a “Forgot Password?” link. When clicked, the user is asked to enter their account email so a password reset link can be sent. Once they receive the email and click the link, they land on a page to enter and confirm a new password. After resetting, they are directed back to the sign-in page to log in with the new credentials.

At any point, once the user is signed in, they can log out by opening a menu under their avatar in the top header and choosing “Sign Out.” This action ends the session and returns them to the welcome page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Right after signing in, the user sees the dashboard, which serves as the central hub for all AI features. The top of the page has a header that displays the app’s logo on the left, a theme toggle button in the center for switching between light and dark modes, and the user’s avatar on the right. Clicking the avatar opens a menu with links to Account Settings, Billing, and Sign Out.

On the left side of the screen is a vertical sidebar listing the main tools: Chat, Search, and Images. Each tool name is displayed with an icon. The sidebar remains visible as the user moves between features. In the center of the page, the Chat tool is shown by default. It displays a list of past conversation threads on the left side of that central area and the active chat window on the right. If the user has no prior conversations, a friendly message invites them to start a new chat.

From this dashboard layout, the user navigates to the Search or Images tools by clicking their names in the sidebar. The content in the main area seamlessly changes to the selected tool, while the header and sidebar remain constant.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user clicks on Chat in the sidebar, the app navigates to the Chat page at the URL `/chat`. The page begins by loading the list of saved threads. To start a new conversation, the user clicks a button labeled “New Chat” above the thread list. A fresh chat window appears on the right. The user types a message in the input field at the bottom of the chat window and presses Enter or clicks the send icon. Their message appears immediately in the chat history. The assistant’s response streams in token by token, giving the appearance of real-time typing. Once the AI model finishes its reply, the entire conversation is saved in the database. The user can rename a thread by clicking its title and editing it inline, or delete a thread via a small trash icon next to its name.

When the user selects Search in the sidebar, they land on the Search page at `/search`. The page displays a simple search box at the top with placeholder text inviting them to enter a query. After typing a question and hitting Search, the app sends the request to the search API and displays summarized results as cards below. Each card shows a short answer, the source, and a button to view more details. Clicking a card expands it inline, revealing a fuller summary and related links. Search history is stored so that returning queries appear as suggestions when the user focuses on the search box again.

If the user chooses Images from the sidebar, the application transitions to the Image Generation page at `/image`. Here, the user sees a text input for a prompt and an optional file upload area for reference images. After entering a prompt and clicking “Generate,” a loading indicator appears while the app communicates with the image-generation service. When the final image is ready, it is displayed below in a gallery view with options to download or save it to the user’s personal library. Each saved image is recorded in the database along with its prompt and generation timestamp.

Throughout these feature flows, the sidebar and header remain fixed, allowing the user to switch tools at any time. URLs update accordingly so users can bookmark or share direct links to specific pages.

## Settings and Account Management

Users manage their personal data and preferences in the Account Settings area, accessible via the avatar menu or a sidebar link labeled Settings. The Settings page opens at `/settings` and is divided into sections. The Profile section lets the user update their display name and email address. To change the password, they must enter their current password and then choose a new one. After saving changes, a confirmation banner appears at the top of the page.

In the Preferences section, users can toggle between light and dark themes or select an accent color if supported. Notification settings allow them to opt in or out of email alerts for new features, chat updates, or security notices. If the app includes subscription features, there is a Billing section where users see their current plan, renewal date, and usage statistics. They can enter or update payment details, upgrade or downgrade their plan, and view past invoices. After any billing update, the system displays a short success message and then the user returns to the main dashboard when they click “Back to Dashboard.”

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If at any point the user loses internet connectivity, a banner appears across the top of the screen warning that the connection is offline. Interactive elements become disabled until the connection returns or the user clicks a Retry button. On form pages such as sign-up, sign-in, or settings, entering invalid data triggers inline validation errors below each affected field. If the chat endpoint encounters an error—due to rate limits or a model timeout—the chat window shows an error message and a “Try Again” button that resends the last user prompt.

When no search results are found, the app displays a friendly note suggesting the user rephrase their query. If image generation fails, a message explains that the request could not be completed and provides a button to retry. Finally, if a user attempts to navigate directly to a protected route without being signed in, they are redirected to the sign-in page with a message explaining that login is required.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a new user lands on the welcome page and creates an account, through signing in and exploring the unified dashboard, the everything-app guides them smoothly into meaningful interactions with AI. They can launch dynamic chat conversations, retrieve summarized insights via search, or generate custom images, all within a single consistent interface. Settings and billing controls remain just a click away while error states and offline warning messages keep the experience clear and reliable. Over time, users build a personal library of chat threads, search queries, and images that they can revisit, refine, and share, making everything-app a true all-in-one AI companion.
