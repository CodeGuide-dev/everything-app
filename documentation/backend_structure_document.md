# Everything-App Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend setup for the **Everything-App** starter kit—a full-stack, AI-powered platform built on Next.js. It covers the overall architecture, database choices, API design, hosting, infrastructure, security, monitoring, and maintenance. By the end, you’ll have a clear picture of how the backend works and why each component was chosen.

## 1. Backend Architecture

**Overview**
The backend is built using Next.js with its App Router and API routes. It runs on Node.js and TypeScript, offering a serverless-friendly structure that can also be packaged as a Docker container.

**Key Design Patterns and Frameworks**
- Feature-based organization: API routes and code are grouped by feature (e.g., `auth`, `chat`, `keys`).
- Server and client components: Next.js App Router separates server-side logic (data fetching, secrets) from client-side UI.
- Type-safe data layer: Drizzle ORM uses TypeScript to ensure your queries match your database schema.
- Authentication layer: `better-auth` handles sign-up, sign-in, and session management.

**Scalability, Maintainability, Performance**
- Scalability: Serverless functions on Vercel or containers on any cloud let you grow without manual server management.
- Maintainability: Clear folder structure, consistent naming, and TypeScript types make onboarding and refactoring easier.
- Performance: Streaming AI responses via Vercel’s `@ai-sdk` minimize latency. Next.js server components reduce client bundle sizes.

## 2. Database Management

**Technology Stack**
- Type: Relational (SQL)
- Database System: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Drizzle ORM (Type-safe, schema-driven queries)

**Data Structure and Access**
- Tables for users, chat sessions, messages, and API keys.
- Drizzle ORM connects using a database URL from environment variables.
- Queries and updates are written in TypeScript, reducing runtime errors.
- Regular backups and migrations can be managed with Drizzle’s built-in tools or external migration services.

**Data Management Practices**
- Use environment variables for database credentials.
- Automated backups scheduled daily (via cloud provider or a cron-job).
- Version-controlled schema definitions in the `db/schema` folder.

## 3. Database Schema

**Human-Readable Overview**
- **Users**: Stores user credentials and profile info.
- **Chat Sessions**: Groups of messages under one conversation.
- **Messages**: Individual entries from users or AI, linked to a session.
- **API Keys**: Keys owned by users to call external AI services.

**PostgreSQL Schema (SQL)**
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Chat sessions table
CREATE TABLE chat_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Messages table
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id UUID REFERENCES chat_sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sender TEXT NOT NULL,       -- 'user' or 'ai'
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- API keys table
CREATE TABLE api_keys (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  key TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  revoked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```  

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

The platform uses **RESTful** API routes in Next.js under the `app/api` directory. All data is exchanged as JSON.

**Authentication (`/api/auth/[...all]`)**
- Handles sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and session checks.
- Integrates with `better-auth` for secure cookie-based sessions.

**Chat Endpoints**
- `POST /api/chat`: Send a user message to the AI model, stream back the response, and save both messages.
- `GET /api/chat/sessions`: List all chat sessions for the authenticated user.
- `GET /api/chat/sessions/{sessionId}`: Retrieve metadata about one session.
- `GET /api/chat/messages?sessionId={sessionId}`: Fetch all messages in a session.

**API Key Management (`/api/keys`)**
- `GET /api/keys`: List all API keys for the user.
- `POST /api/keys`: Create a new API key (with a user-defined name).
- `DELETE /api/keys/{keyId}`: Revoke an existing key.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

**Primary Host: Vercel**
- Serverless functions power the API routes.
- Global edge network delivers static assets and server components.
- Automatic scaling based on traffic.

**Alternative: Docker**
- Standalone output mode in Next.js (`output: 'standalone'`) packages the app.
- Deploy to any container host (AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Azure App Service).

**Benefits**
- Reliability: Vercel SLA and automatic fallback.
- Scalability: Pay-per-use serverless or container-based auto-scaling.
- Cost-Effectiveness: No idle server costs, only pay for actual usage.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **Load Balancer**: Vercel’s built-in routing balances traffic across serverless instances.
- **Caching**: 
  - Static files and assets served via Vercel CDN.
  - API responses can use HTTP caching headers or an external cache like Redis.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Vercel Edge Network or Cloudflare for low-latency global delivery.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed securely in Vercel dashboard or via secrets manager in cloud.

## 7. Security Measures

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Secure cookies managed by `better-auth`.
  - API routes verify user sessions on each request.
- **Data Encryption**
  - TLS for all network traffic (HTTPS).
  - Encrypt sensitive environment variables at rest.
- **Input Validation**
  - Use libraries like Zod to validate request bodies before processing.
- **Secret Management**
  - No hardcoded secrets; all keys and credentials in environment variables.
- **Best Practices**
  - HTTP security headers (CSP, XSS protection).
  - Rate limiting on chat and key endpoints.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Vercel Analytics for response times and error rates.
  - Optionally integrate Sentry for error tracking and alerting.
- **Logging**
  - Structured logs using a library (e.g., Pino or Winston) sent to a log service (Logflare, Datadog).
- **Backups and Migrations**
  - Scheduled database backups via cloud provider.
  - Drizzle migrations in version control for schema changes.
- **Dependency Updates**
  - Use automated tools (Dependabot) to keep packages up to date.
- **Maintenance Window**
  - Plan minor updates during low-traffic periods; leverage Vercel’s zero-downtime deployments.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The Everything-App backend uses Next.js API routes, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM to power a real-time AI chat platform with user authentication and API key management. Hosted on Vercel with Docker support, it benefits from serverless scaling, global CDNs, and modern security practices. Clear code organization and type safety ensure maintainability, while monitoring and automated backups keep the system reliable. This setup provides a solid foundation to extend with future AI features—like search or image generation—without reworking the core backend.
