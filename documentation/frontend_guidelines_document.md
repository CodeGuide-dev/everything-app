# Frontend Guideline Document

This document outlines the frontend architecture, design principles, and technologies for the **everything-app**. It explains each part using everyday language so anyone can understand how the frontend is set up and why.

## 1. Frontend Architecture

### Frameworks and Libraries
- **Next.js (App Router)**: Our main framework. It handles page routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and static generation. It’s the backbone of our frontend.
- **React**: Used for building the user interface in a component-based way.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety, reducing bugs by checking data shapes at compile time.
- **shadcn/ui & Tailwind CSS**: Provides a ready-made, accessible design system and utility-first CSS for styling.
- **assistant-ui**: A React component library designed for chat interfaces, built on top of shadcn/ui and Tailwind.
- **@ai-sdk (Vercel)**: Client library for talking to AI models, enabling real-time streaming conversations.

### How the Architecture Supports Scalability, Maintainability, and Performance
- **Scalability**: Every AI feature (Chat, Search, Image Generation) lives in its own **`app/feature`** folder, making it easy to add or remove features.
- **Maintainability**: Components are broken into small, reusable pieces in **`components/`**. Styles use consistent naming and utility classes, minimizing style conflicts.
- **Performance**: Next.js handles code splitting automatically. We use dynamic imports, lazy loading of heavy modules (like image-generation UI), and optimized assets with the built-in Image component.

## 2. Design Principles

### Key Principles
1. **Usability**: Clear layouts and intuitive controls. Buttons, inputs, and feedback messages are easy to find and understand.
2. **Accessibility**: All components follow WCAG guidelines. We use semantic HTML, proper labels, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes.
3. **Responsiveness**: The UI adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens via Tailwind’s responsive utilities.
4. **Consistency**: A shared design system (shadcn/ui + Tailwind) ensures uniform look and feel.
5. **Performance**: Fast load times and smooth interactions by leveraging Next.js optimizations.

### Applying Principles to the UI
- Forms and inputs include clear labels and error messages.
- Dark mode toggle ensures readability in low-light conditions.
- Components like buttons, cards, and sidebars use consistent spacing and color hierarchies.

## 3. Styling and Theming

### Styling Approach
- **CSS Methodology**: Utility-first with Tailwind CSS. Minimal custom CSS; most styles come from Tailwind classes.
- **Pre-processor**: No additional pre-processor is needed—Tailwind handles all customizations.

### Theming
- **Dark & Light Mode**: Controlled via a React context and `className` on the `<html>` element. Tailwind’s `dark:` variants adjust colors.
- **Custom Themes**: Use Tailwind’s configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) to define new color sets or extend the theme.

### Visual Style
- **Overall Style**: Modern flat design with glassmorphism accents (subtle frosted backgrounds on modals and sidebars).
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary: #3B82F6 (blue-500)
  - Secondary: #6366F1 (indigo-500)
  - Accent: #10B981 (emerald-500)
  - Neutral Background: #F9FAFB (gray-50) / #1F2937 (gray-800 in dark mode)
  - Surface / Cards: #FFFFFF / #374151 (dark mode)
  - Text: #111827 (gray-900) / #F3F4F6 (gray-100 in dark mode)
  - Border: #E5E7EB (gray-200) / #4B5563 (gray-600 in dark mode)

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter (system UI fallback). Chosen for readability and modern feel.
- **Font Sizes**: Defined in Tailwind (`text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, etc.).
- **Line Heights & Spacing**: Consistent vertical rhythm using Tailwind’s spacing scale.

## 4. Component Structure

### Organization
- **`app/`**: Contains page routes (`/chat`, `/search`, `/image`, `/dashboard`, etc.).
- **`components/`**: Houses reusable React components.
  - **`ui/`**: Low-level UI building blocks from shadcn/ui (buttons, inputs, modals).
  - **Feature-specific folders**: e.g., `components/chat/`, `components/search/`, `components/image/`.
- **`lib/`**: Utility functions, such as AI API client wrappers and common helpers.
- **`db/`**: Drizzle ORM schema and database utilities.

### Reuse and Consistency
- Each component is small (single responsibility) and styled with Tailwind.
- Shared components (`Button`, `Card`, `Header`) ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

### Benefits of Component-Based Architecture
- **Maintainability**: Fix or update a component in one place, changes ripple through the app.
- **Testability**: Isolated components are easier to unit test.
- **Reusability**: Common patterns and UI elements get used across multiple features.

## 5. State Management

### Approach and Libraries
- **Zustand**: Lightweight store for client-side state, ideal for conversation state, model selection, theme mode.
- **React Context**: For global concerns like authentication status and theming.
- **Local Component State**: For UI-specific data (e.g., popover open/close, form inputs).

### Sharing State Across Components
- **Chat Store**: Holds the current thread, messages array, and streaming status. Components subscribe to updates.
- **Theme Context**: Provides `darkMode` boolean and `toggleTheme()`.
- **Auth Context**: Tracks `user`, `session`, and `signIn`/`signOut` methods.

## 6. Routing and Navigation

### Routing
- **Next.js App Router**: File-based routing under `app/`. Example: `app/chat/page.tsx` renders the chat UI.
- **API Routes**: Next.js API endpoints under `app/api/` (e.g., `app/api/chat/route.ts` handles chat requests).

### Navigation
- **Header & Sidebar**: `site-header.tsx` and `app-sidebar.tsx` provide links to Dashboard, Chat, Search, Image Generator.
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard and AI tools are wrapped in a `RequireAuth` component that redirects to sign-in if unauthenticated.
- **Breadcrumbs & Back Buttons**: Help users understand where they are in nested pages.

## 7. Performance Optimization

### Strategies
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**: Dynamic import of heavy components (e.g., image generator UI).
- **Next.js Image Optimization**: Use `next/image` for AI-generated images or uploaded files.
- **Caching & SWR**: Cache repeated API calls (e.g., user preferences) using SWR or React Query.
- **Asset Optimization**: Compress icons and images, use SVGs where possible.
- **Streaming Responses**: For chat, stream model responses so the UI can update progressively.

### Impact on User Experience
- Faster initial page loads.
- Smooth scrolling and UI interactions.
- Immediate feedback in chat as the AI streams tokens.

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and utilities with **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
- **Integration Tests**: Test page flows and API endpoints using **Supertest** (for Next.js API routes) or **MSW** (for mocking).
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real user interactions with **Cypress** or **Playwright**. Cover key flows: login, chat conversation, search query, image generation.
- **Accessibility Tests**: Use **axe-core** or **jest-axe** to catch common accessibility issues.

### Tools and Frameworks
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Enforce code style and catch common errors early.
- **Playwright/Cypress**: Automate E2E tests in CI.
- **GH Actions**: Run linting, tests, and builds on each pull request.
- **Storybook (optional)**: Preview and manually test UI components in isolation.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary

The **everything-app** frontend is built on Next.js, React, and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a modern, accessible design. Its component-based structure and clear separation of concerns make it easy to scale and maintain. State is managed cleanly with Zustand and React Context. Routing is handled by Next.js App Router, with protected areas for authenticated users. Performance optimizations like code splitting, streaming responses, and asset optimization ensure a smooth user experience. Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and E2E) rounds out a solid quality assurance process.

This setup aligns with our goal of creating a flexible, high-performance “super app” that starts with AI Chat and can grow to include search, image generation, and beyond—all while ensuring consistency, accessibility, and developer happiness.
